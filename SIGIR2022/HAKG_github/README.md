Paper in [ACM DL](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3477495.3531987) or Paper in [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.04959). In SIGIR'22, Madrid, Spain, July 11â€“15, 2022.

## Introduction

Hierarchy-Aware Knowledge Gated Network (HAKG) is a new recommendation framework tailored to knowledge-aware recommendation. Built upon the hyperbolic space and graph neural network framework, HAKG explicitly models the hierarchical structures and relations in user-item graph and KG, and propose a novel dual item embeddings design to represent and propagate collaborative signals and knowledge associations separately.

## Environment Requirements

- Ubuntu OS
- Python >= 3.8 (Anaconda3 is recommended)
- PyTorch == 1.8
- networkx == 2.5
- A Nvidia GPU with cuda 11.1+

## Datasets

We user three popular datasets: Alibaba-iFashion, Yelp2018 and Last-FM to conduct experiments.
* We follow the paper "[Learning Intents behind Interactions with Knowledge Graph for Recommendation]()" to process data.
* You can find the full version of recommendation datasets via [Alibaba-iFashion](https://github.com/wenyuer/POG), [Yelp2018](https://www.heywhale.com/mw/dataset/5ecbc342fac16e0036ec41a0) and [Last-FM](http://www.cp.jku.at/datasets/LFM-1b/).
* [New] We have added all datasets in our paper, and it can be found in [here](https://github.com/zealscott/HAKG/tree/main/data).

## Reproducibility & Training

To demonstrate the reproducibility of the best performance reported in our paper and faciliate researchers to track whether the model status is consistent with ours, we provide the best parameter settings (might be different for the custormized datasets) in the scripts, and provide [the log for our trainings](./result/).

- Alibaba-iFashion dataset
```shell
python main.py --dataset alibaba-ifashion --lr 0.0001 --angle_loss_w 0.005 --context_hops 3 --num_neg_sample 200 --margin 0.6
```

- Yelp2018 dataset
```shell
python main.py --dataset yelp2018 --lr 0.0005 --angle_loss_w 0.005 --context_hops 2 --num_neg_sample 400 --margin 0.8
```

- Last-FM dataset
```shell
python main.py --dataset last-fm --lr 0.0001 --angle_loss_w 0.005 --context_hops 3 --num_neg_sample 400 --margin 0.7
```
